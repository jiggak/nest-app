The supplied init script always loads `/retherm/config.toml`. The file must
exist even though every setting inside it is optional. A minimal working file
is:

```toml
[home_assistant]
friendly_name = "Hallway Nest"
node_name = "hallway-nest"
```

See [Home Assistant](/home-assistant/) for the connection procedure and optional
ESPHome Noise encryption. The complete generated setting reference follows.

Duration fields accept an integer number of seconds or a string ending in `s`
or `m`, such as `30s` or `5m`. The current parser rejects `h`-suffixed values;
express hours as minutes instead.

# Config file

Launch retherm with the path to your custom configuration.

```bash
retherm --config ./your_config.toml
```

All config options have a default; you only need to include options
you would like to override in your configuration file.

## temp_deadband

The temperature difference from the setpoint required to trigger an action.

For example, with a target heat temp of 20, and deadband set to 0.4,
the hvac system will turn heat on when temp drops to 19.6.

Defaults to 0.6

## temp_overrun

The temperature difference past the setpoint required to stop an action.

For example, with a target heat temp of 20, and overrun set to 0.2,
the hvac system will turn heat off when temp reaches 20.2.

Defaults to 0.4

## min_off_time

Minimum idle time before ReTherm energizes a new HVAC action. This also
provides compressor protection by allowing refrigerant pressures to
equalize.

Defaults to "5m"

## default_fan_timeout

Default amount of time to run fan, when fan mode is activated.

Defaults to "15m"

## storage_dir

Directory to store app state.

Defaults to "/media/data"

# Away Mode

```toml
[away_mode]
temp_heat = 16.0
temp_cool = 20.0
timeout = "0s"
```

## temp_heat

Away temp for heating mode, default 16.0

## temp_cool

Away temp for cooling mode, default 22.0

## timeout

Duration of no proximity movement before going into away mode,
or set to zero to disable away mode. Default "30m".

# Backplate

```toml
[backplate]
near_pir_threshold = 15
serial_port = "/dev/ttyO2"
wiring = { type = "HeatAndCool", heat_wire = "W1", cool_wire = "Y1", fan_wire = "G" }
```

## near_pir_threshold

Minimum near proximity value to be considered as movement, default 15

## serial_port

Path to backplate serial device file, default "/dev/ttyO2"

## wiring

HVAC wiring configuration. Defaults to
`{ type = "HeatAndCool", heat_wire = "W1", cool_wire = "Y1", fan_wire = "G" }`.
Valid wire names: W1, Y1, G, OB, W2, Y2, Star.

# Home Assistant

```toml
[home_assistant]
friendly_name = "Hallway"
encryption_key = "..."
```

## object_id

ESPHome climate object ID used by Home Assistant.
Defaults to "climate.{node_name}".

## listen_addr

Bind address for the ESPHome Native API server.
Defaults to "0.0.0.0:6053", which listens on all IPv4 interfaces.

## encryption_key

ESPHome Noise encryption key as a base64-encoded 32-byte value.
When not provided, the connection uses plaintext messages. The same key
must be supplied to Home Assistant.
See [ESP Home Native API](https://esphome.io/components/api/)
for a tool that generates a random key.

## server_info

Server info (not typically displayed in Home Assistant).
Defaults to "ReTherm {version}".

## node_name

ESPHome node name. Defaults to the system hostname, or "retherm" if the
hostname cannot be read.

## friendly_name

Friendly device name displayed in Home Assistant.
Defaults to "ReTherm Thermostat".

## manufacturer

Manufacturer name, defaults to "Nest".

## model

Model name, defaults to "Gen2 Thermostat".

## mac_address

MAC address, defaults to an address found on a system interface. A
fallback value is used if no address can be read.

# Backlight

```toml
[backlight]
brightness = 108
timeout = "15s"
```

## brightness

Screen brightness, defaults to 108 (max 120)

## timeout

Timeout before screen turns off, defaults to "15s"

# Schedule

```toml
[[schedule_heat]]
days_of_week = "EveryDay"
set_points = [
   { time = "08:00", temp = 20.0 },
   { time = "22:00", temp = 16.0 },
]
```

* Heating schedule `[[schedule_heat]]`
* Cooling schedule `[[schedule_cool]]`

You can define more than one schedule entry, and it will overlap the
previous. In the example below, the temperature will be set to 20.0
at 8am every day, and set down to 16.0 at 9am Monday and Wednesday.

```toml
[[schedule_heat]]
days_of_week = "EveryDay"
set_points = [
   { time = "08:00", temp = 20.0 }
]

[[schedule_heat]]
days_of_week = ["Mon", "Wed"]
set_points = [
   { time = "09:00", temp = 16.0 }
]
```

## days_of_week

Days of the week.

One of "EveryDay", "WeekDays", "WeekEnd"

Or...

List of weekday values: "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun".

## set_points

List of set points with time of day and temperature
